# SafariWebExtensionBugs
This is a repository for tracking issues with Safariâ€™s Web Extensions APIs.

Privacy extension developers created this repository to publicly document issues that have made it difficult to develop extensions for Safari. As a result, this list is focused on issues affecting privacy or content blocking web extensions. Developers are encouraged to open issues for Safari bugs that impact the development of privacy extensions. For other issues impacting Safari extension development, feel free to use https://github.com/lapcat/SafariExtensions. 

This effort aims to facilitate information sharing and increase visibility of Safari web extensions bugs, because Apple's bug reporting system (Feedback Assistant) is private.
